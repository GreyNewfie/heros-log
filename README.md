# Hero's Log
HeroQuest character, items and quest tracker

This is my first project for the [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) program. I used html, css and vabilla javascript. Hero's Log is a companion app for the HeroQuest board game. It allows players to track their character(s), items and quest progress. There's also an items library that contains all of the item cards in the game for players to be able to reference.
